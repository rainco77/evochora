          You are an expert Java developer. Please act as a code reviewer. Review the following code changes for potential bugs, style violations, and improvements. Focus on correctness, clarity, and adherence to best practices. Provide constructive feedback. The code diff is:

          ```diff
          EOT
          
          # Append the diff from the file
          cat pr_diff.txt >> prompt.txt
          
          echo '```' >> prompt.txt

          # Generate the review by piping the prompt file into the gemini command
          REVIEW_COMMENT=$(cat prompt.txt | gemini)
          
          # Make the comment available to the next step
          echo "comment<<EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "$REVIEW_COMMENT" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
