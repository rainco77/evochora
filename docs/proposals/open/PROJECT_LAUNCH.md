# Evochora: Project Launch and Community Building Plan

This document outlines the strategic three-phase plan for the launch and community cultivation of the Evochora project. All public-facing materials will be in English.

---

## Phase 1: üèõÔ∏è The Foundation

**Goal:** To prepare the project to be welcoming, understandable, and professional for newcomers before the public announcement.

### 1. Core Documentation (in the repository, in English)
- **`README.md`**: The central "front door" explaining the vision, key features, a getting started guide, and links to the community.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: The "rulebook" for developers, detailing the development setup, coding style, and the pull request process.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: The community's values, fostering an inclusive and respectful culture (e.g., based on the Contributor Covenant).
- **`LICENSE`**: The legal framework (e.g., MIT License) to enable usage and contributions from others.

### 2. Communication Channels (Setup)
- **Activate GitHub Discussions**: Create initial categories (e.g., "Scientific Theory," "Development," "Q&A").
- **Create a Discord Server**: Set up essential channels (`#welcome`, `#general`, `#dev-talk`).

### 3. The Public Roadmap
- **Set up a GitHub Project Board**: To transparently track planned features and ongoing work (using columns like "Ideas," "Planned," "In Progress").
- **Define and add visionary goals to the roadmap** to showcase the project's long-term potential:
    - *Near-Term Goal:* "Fat Jar Packaging" for easier local execution.
    - *Long-Term Vision:* "Fully Interactive Web Environment" for a complete in-browser experience.

### 4. Onboarding & User Experience
- **Create a "Hello World" organism** (`hello-world.asm`) that performs a simple, visible action in the web debugger for an instant "aha!" moment.
- **Prepare the infrastructure for a hosted live demo** of the web debugger, allowing interested users to get a first impression with zero installation.

## Phase 2: üöÄ The Launch

**Goal:** To introduce the project to its target audience with a coordinated announcement to generate initial interest and attention.

### 1. Create a Scientific Anchor
- **Write a short "Project Introduction Paper"** (2-4 pages) in English, describing Evochora's vision, architecture, and open research questions.
- **Publish this paper as a pre-print on arXiv.org** to give the project academic credibility and a citable reference.

### 2. Prepare and Execute the Announcement
- **Draft a "launch" announcement** (e.g., for a blog post or social media thread).
- **Prominently feature the link to the live demo** in the announcement.
- **Include links** to the GitHub repository and the arXiv paper.

### 3. Targeted Outreach
- **Post the announcement in relevant scientific and technical communities**, such as:
    - Subreddits (e.g., `r/alife`, `r/evolution`).
    - Academic mailing lists (e.g., the ISAL mailing list).

## Phase 3: üå± Community Cultivation

**Goal:** To convert initial interest into sustainable, active participation and foster a growing community.

### 1. Be Present and Responsive
- **Be active on Discord and in GitHub Discussions**, answering questions and responding to feedback.
- **Provide timely feedback** on issues and pull requests.

### 2. Lower the Barrier for Contributors
- **Label simple, well-defined tasks with `good first issue`** to help new developers get started.

### 3. Acknowledge and Value Contributions
- **Publicly thank everyone for their contributions**, whether it's code, bug reports, or discussions.
- **Keep the roadmap up-to-date** and actively solicit community feedback on future priorities.

### 4. Empower Community Members
- **Gradually grant more responsibility to engaged members**, such as moderation rights or triage permissions on issues.
