# What is Evochora?
### A Collaborative Platform for Research into the Foundational Physics of Open-Endedness and Major Transitions
#### 1. The Vision: Why Evochora?
The Problem: Most Artificial Life simulations have a fixed "physics." Evolution can optimize organisms within these rules, but it cannot change the rules themselves. This leads to stagnation.
The Solution: Evochora makes the fundamental laws of the digital universe (energy, mutation, space) configurable and extensible. It is a tool to ask: What kind of universe allows for open-ended evolution?

#### 2. The Engine: How it Works
Evochora is not just a simulation; it is a high-performance **Virtual Machine** for **Embodied Agents**.
* **Embodied Agency (IP vs. DP)**
    * **Instruction Pointer (IP):** The "Brain". Executes code logic.
    * **Data Pointers (DPs):** The "Limbs". Interact with the world (Move, Eat, Build).
    * *Result:* Intelligence is not just calculation; it is navigating a physical world.
* **Extensible Physics**
    * **Typed Molecules:** The world consists of CODE, DATA, ENERGY, and STRUCTURE, and extensible
    * **Plugins:** Swap out how energy appears (Sunlight vs. Geysers) or how mutation works (Copy Error vs. Radiation).
* **Bioenergetics**
    * Every instruction costs energy.
    * Organisms must actively forage to survive.
    * *Hypothesis:* This constraint drives the evolution of efficiency and cooperation (Multicellularity).

#### 3. The Invitation: Join the Research
Evochora is an open-source instrument for the scientific community. We are currently investigating:
* **Stability:** Exploring physical vs. behavioral mechanisms to mitigate "Grey Goo" and Error Catastrophe beyond simple penalties.
* **Multicellularity:** Can internal parallelism (multi-threading) lead to social cooperation?
* **Chemistry:** Evolving complex metabolic reaction chains.
